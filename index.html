        <p>Ambigram is a kind of art that is designed in such as way that a word or a group of words within it can be presented the same or different from the original word or words when you view them from another viewpoint, direction or orientation. The most common ambigram is the rotational ambigram. a word or a group of words will appear the same when you read them upside down (as shown in the picture)in a rotational ambigram design. Good ambigram designs are usually customized ones created by hand. It is not easy to design a perfect ambigram generator. However, there are two generator so far have been designed. They are the Ambimatic, which is free and the Glyphusion Ambigram Generator, which is a commercial one. As we have said, a perfect ambigram generator involves tremendous work and you can not expect too much from them. If you really want one, go for an ambigram artist.
Here we have collected some ambigram fonts for you to generate and have a try on them. As we have said, do not expect too much from ambigram software such as a generator or a font. OK, here comes two ambigram fonts, they are One Eighty and Lake Reflection from Daan Juttmann. One Eighty will allow you to generate letters (not words) that can be read as another one when read upside down. Lake Reflection will allow you to generate words that can be read as if they are being reflected in a lake.
